	abstract = {The present study examines the factors affecting the market share of the dominant firm in long-distance telecommunications, AT\&T. A theoretical model is specified which includes competing long-distance rates (e.g., those of MCI and U.S. Sprint), price-cap regulation and advertising expenditures as determinants of the dominant firm's market share. Using intercity long-distance carrier charges for 1984â€“1994, this study points out the importance of AT\&T's own rate structure, those of its major competitors, and government regulations in determining AT\&T's market share over time.},

	abstract = {The economic well-being of a business firm can often be summarized in terms of its market share. Market share responds to price, advertising expenditures, retail availability, and product characteristics. Marketing managers are compelled to understand the dynamics of market share behavior in these terms. This article is an analysis of market share movements for a low-cost, frequently purchased consumer product. It represents a first effort in understanding such movements for marketing management's major decision variables.},
