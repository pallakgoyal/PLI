	abstract = {Much of the data available today is unstructured and text-heavy, making it challenging for analysts to apply their usual data wrangling and visualization tools. With this practical book, youll explore text-mining techniques with tidytext, a package that authors Julia Silge and David Robinson developed using the tidy principles behind R packages like ggraph and dplyr. Youll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in R can make text analysis easier and more effective. The authors demonstrate how treating text as data frames enables you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics of text. Youll also learn how to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into effective workflows. Practical code examples and data explorations will help you generate real insights from literature, news, and social media. Learn how to apply the tidy text format to NLPUse sentiment analysis to mine the emotional content of text Identify a documents most important terms with frequency measurements Explore relationships and connections between words with the ggraph and widyr packages Convert back and forth between Rs tidy and non-tidy text formatsUse topic modeling to classify document collections into natural groups Examine case studies that compare Twitter archives, dig into NASA metadata, and analyze thousands of Usenet messages},

We find that firms’ investment behaviour has relatively little dependency on a country’s macroeconomic setting. Additionally, we find that, on average, firms that are completely foreign-owned have a relatively lower investment-to-sales ratio. Finally, we find evidence which suggests that the probability of investing is higher for firms located in countries with more control of corruption and we find some evidence which suggests that partially foreign-owned firms located in countries with relatively less corruption have a relatively higher investment-to-sales ratio.},

This effect is more pronounced for small firms and firms dependent on short-term debt. However, our results are indifferent to domestic versus foreign investing firm groups.},

	abstract = {We study the governance role of Russian financial–industrial groups (FIG) and their impact on the allocation of capital. We compare member firms of groups with a control set of firms categorized by dispersed ownership or/and management and employee control. We distinguish between hierarchical FIGs, where a bank is in firm control, and industry groups, which are looser alliances without a common control structure. We find that investment is sensitive to internal finance for the non-group firms. Industry group firms are not different from the independent firms in that respect, while there is negative correlation in bank-led group firms, suggesting extensive financial reallocation and the use of profitable firms as cash cows. These results suggest either an internal capital market which redirects finance to firms with better investment opportunities or opportunistic value transfers by the controlling banks. We further assess the quality of the investment process in group and non-group firms by measuring the correlation of investment with a proxy for Tobin's Q. The result supports the notion that hierarchical group firms allocate capital comparatively better than other firms, presumably because the controlling bank has a stronger profit motive and authority. However, the extent of redistribution is such that private appropriation of value by the controlling shareholders is a serious possibility.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, based on the value optimization problem of the firm, the authors proposed a theoretical model for firms’ investment decisions, which incorporates the effects of both idiosyncratic (firm specific) and macroeconomic uncertainty/risk. Second, the authors empirically estimate the proposed model for Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach The authors utilize an unbalanced firm-level panel data covering the period 1988-2013. To generate time-variant firm-specific uncertainty, the authors estimate the autoregressive model on firm sales for each firm included in the sample over the examined period. Firm-specific risk is also measured based on the square of the residuals of firms’ sales. Two measures of macroeconomic uncertainty are computed using the conditional variance obtained by estimating the ARCH model for consumer price index and industrial production index. Several alternative measures of both types of uncertainties are used to ensure the robustness of uncertainty effects. To mitigate the problem of endogeneity, the robust two-step system-generalized method of moments estimator is used to estimate the empirical model. Findings The results indicate that firms are likely to cut down their level of investment spending when either type of uncertainty increases. The results also reveal that the sensitivity of firms’ investment decisions to macroeconomic (aggregate) uncertainty is higher as compared to the firm-specific uncertainty. The authors show that these findings are robust to different uncertainty measures used in the analysis. The results related to firm characteristics suggest that the firm-specific variables namely the debt to assets ratio, the costs of debt to assets ratio, and the sales to assets ratio are also equally important in the determination of investment decisions of corporate manufacturing firms. Practical implications The empirical findings of the paper are useful for firm managers, investors, and government authority. Specifically, the results help firm managers and investors to understand how firm-specific and macroeconomic uncertainty affects firms’ investment decisions. The finding that firms cut their investment spending in times of macroeconomic instability implies that declines in firms’ investment spending during the periods of macroeconomic turmoil may delay the process of recovery. Therefore, the policy makers should design such policies that encourage firms to invest more in economic crisis periods, which, in turn, would enhance the growth of the economy and help to overcome the problem of downturn/recession. Originality/value The authors first propose a theoretical model for firms’ investment decisions based on the value optimization problem of the firm by incorporating the role of both firm-specific and macroeconomic uncertainty. Next, unlike most of previous studies, they estimate the proposed model for non-financial firms operating in Pakistan. The authors predict that a higher exposure to both idiosyncratic and macroeconomic uncertainties leads to lower investment in Pakistani manufacturing firms. Further, the authors hypothesize that both types of uncertainties have differential effects on firms’ investment decisions.},
